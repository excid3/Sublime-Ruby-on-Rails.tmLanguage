# Monokai Theme and better Rails formatting for Sublime Text 2

![screenshot](http://cl.ly/1v012g2b1t0l0v2c101m/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-18%20at%201.00.14%20AM.png)

This includes updates to include common syntax highlighting for Rails

* Properly highlights instance variables (addition to Monokai)
* Highlights extra Rails keywords:
    * session
    * params

# Installation

Just place these folders in your Sublime packages folder. I'm on a Mac, so that is located at  ```~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages```. You'll need to find the equivalent folders on Windows and Linux.

The Rails syntax highlighting will work automatically. In order to use the Monokai theme, just open your user preferences (Command + ,) and add this option:

```
	"color_scheme": "Packages/Monokai/Monokai.tmTheme"
```
