# Monokai Theme and better Rails formatting for Sublime Text 2

This includes updates to include common syntax highlighting for Rails

* Properly highlights instance variables (addition to Monokai)
* Highlights extra Rails keywords:
    * session
    * params

# Installation

Just place these folders in your Sublime packages folder. I'm on a Mac, so that is located at  ```~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages```. You'll need to find the equivalent folders on Windows and Linux.
